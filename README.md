A lightweight java library that implements [Consistent hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing). It borrows heavily from open source projects and blogs. The consistent hashing code is based on Tom White's blog at http://www.tom-e-white.com/2007/11/consistent-hashing.html and the default hash function is Murmur3 taken from the Apache Hive project.
